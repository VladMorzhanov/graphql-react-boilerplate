# GraphQL React Boilerplate

GraphQL + React Boilerplate allows you to start new web project from scratch using React, Apollo, Typescript, Mobx-State-Tree, Mobx and Styled components.
Based on <a href="https://github.com/VladMorzhanov/mst-react-boilerplate">Mobx-State-Tree React Boilerplate</a>

Also this boilerplate contains babel configuration to use decorators from ES7 and HMR with React.
