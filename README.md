GraphQL + React Boilerplate allows you to start new web project from scratch using React, Apollo, Mobx-State-Tree, Mobx and Styled components.
Based on <a href="https://github.com/VladMorzhanov/mst-react-boilerplate">Mobx-State-Tree React Boilerplate</a>

Also this boilerplate contains babel configuration to use decorators from ES7 and HMR with React.

This is a frontend part of GraphQL boilerplate projects. You can also review <a href="https://github.com/VladMorzhanov/graphql-nodejs-boilerplate">graphql-nodejs-boilerplate</a> to see how things works on the backend side with NodeJS and Express.
